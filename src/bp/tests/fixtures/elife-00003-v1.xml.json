        "text": "We previously discovered histones bound to cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs); here we show that this forms a cellular antibacterial defense system. Sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. Droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into <i>Drosophila</i> embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. In contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. Embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species. Our data suggests that this intracellular antibacterial defense system may function in adult flies, and also potentially in mice.",

While not generally appreciated, histones and histone fragments are surprisingly bactericidal in in vitro assays (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hirsch, 1958</a>). Thus, in principle histones could provide animals with a potent supply of microbicides for protection against bacterial invasion. In some cases, histones are released extracellularly, and then contribute to innate immunity against bacteria. For example, in the skin mucosa of catfish, secreted histone H2A contributes critically to the organismal defense against bacteria (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cho et al., 2002</a>), and histones H3 and H4 are prominent antimicrobial agents in sebaceous gland secretions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2009</a>).",

In principle, then, histones normally present in cells could confer protection against microbes that exploit intracellular niches. However, until now this has seemed unlikely for two reasons. First, histones typically are located in the nucleus, excluding contact with cytosolic bacteria. Second, histones are generally believed to be predominantly bound to DNA, with only minuscule amounts of excess histones. In fact, because unconfined histones cause genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and lethality (<a href=\"#bib29\">Saffarzadeh et al., 2012</a>), cells minimize excess free histones by active mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib31\">Singh et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2009b</a>).

Embryos injected with bacteria have considerably higher survival success when they have droplet-bound histones, establishing that histones on LDs contribute to innate immunity in embryos.

Dilute suspensions of bacteria were grown in the presence or absence of potential antimicrobial agents (LDs equivalent to ∼500 μg total proteins and controls), and colony forming units (CFU) on an agar plate were counted after 24 hr of incubation with the agents.

Thus, one potential source of antibacterial activity might be fatty acids released due to breakdown of the abundant triglycerides; because of their detergent-like properties, they might destroy bacterial membranes and thus impair bacterial viability. We therefore treated purified LDs with alkaline washes. This treatment removes electrostatically bound droplet proteins, but not lipids and proteins attached via hydrophobic interactions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brasaemle et al., 2004</a>). Indeed, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cermelli et al., 2006</a>), these washes greatly reduced the levels of the electrostatically bound histone H2B, but not of the hydrophobically bound LSD-2. These treated droplets no longer had antibacterial activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, LD-CaCO<sub>3</sub>), suggesting that the antimicrobial activity requires electrostatically bound proteins.",

In principle, any of them might be responsible for the antibacterial activity, but it seems likely that the active agents would be present in high copy number. We thus performed a traditional gel overlay assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), visualizing these high-copy number proteins by Coomassie stain. Droplet proteins were separated by Acid Urea (AU) gel electrophoresis, and the gel was overlain with nutrient agar seeded with bacteria. As in the disc assay, antibacterial proteins diffuse into the agar and locally inhibit bacterial growth, as shown by the positive control mouse α-defensin cryptdin-4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, gel overlay violet arrow). The lipid-droplet lane contained significant antibacterial activity in only one location (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, gel overlay red arrow). MS analyses of proteins eluted from this location identified histones H2A and H2B as the predominant proteins present (spectra not shown). Therefore, the bactericidal activity of LDs is most likely due to histones, consistent with their known antimicrobial activities in vitro (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hirsch, 1958</a>). Importantly, pretreatment of purified LDs with anti-histone antibodies abolished or markedly reduced the droplet bactericidal activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, 1B-LD + Anti-histones).

First, using mass spectrometry, we compared post-translational modifications on droplet-bound and nuclear histones and found no major distinctions, suggesting that unique post translation modifications are not responsible for association of histones to LDs. Since our analysis was mostly qualitative, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences might arise from quantitative changes in post-translation modifications. We did identify several acetylation sites in histones H2A (serine 1 and lysines 5 and 8) and histone H2B (lysines 7, 11, 14 and 17). Some of these acetylation sites were previously found in shrimp histones (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ouvry-Patat and Schey, 2007</a>). The histones previously examined for antimicrobial activity are reported to be un-acetylated (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kim et al., 2000</a>), though there was no indication of whether acetylation affected antimicrobial efficacy. Second, we compared the antibacterial potencies of droplet-derived histones with commercial calf thymus histones isolated from a calf thymus nuclear fraction in both bactericidal (killing bacteria outright) and bacteriostatic (inhibiting the growth or reproduction of bacteria) activity assays. Histones extracted from droplets using AU gel electrophoresis were combined with a suspension of <i>E. coli</i> ML35 for 1 hr, and bacterial cell survival was determined by measuring CFU. This assay showed that histones are bactericidal and that droplet-derived histones and commercial pan-histones purified from calf thymus do not differ significantly in antibacterial efficacy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).",

We used two <i>Jabba</i> alleles, derived independently. <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>zl01</i></sup> is due to imprecise excision of a P element inserted near the <i>Jabba</i> promoter, and <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>f07560</i></sup> is due to the insertion of a PBac element in the middle of the <i>Jabba</i> coding region. The two alleles were generated from entirely different genetic backgrounds, ruling out genetic background effects.

Second, when living embryos are centrifuged, LDs separate from the rest of the embryonic content and form a distinct layer (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cermelli et al., 2006</a>).

Further, lacking cytosolic bacteria, the systemic circulating LPS is unlikely to be present inside the cells at high enough dosage to release the histones from the droplets. In the second case, purified droplets with histones are exposed directly to LPS, mimicking the presence of bacteria inside of cells. In this latter case, there are no signaling effects, because in the purified system no signaling apparatus is present.

We searched in each embryo for the region(s) with the most bacteria visible, and quantified that number, using images with same field of view. At least three different embryos were used in each group. At the same time, we noted how many such high-bacteria fields were typically present in an embryo, as well as typical bacterial counts in the other fields. We estimate the embryo can be covered by approximately 10 independent fields of 40 µ each. For the wild-type, at t = 2 hr, the average number of bacteria in the (maximal) field of view was 24.3 ± 6.4, and there were between three and four such fields per embryo, with few bacteria elsewhere, leading to an estimate of ∼84 bacteria per embryo. For the <i>Jabba</i> mutant embryo, the average number of bacteria in the (maximal) field of view was 23.3 ± 3.2, and there were between three and four such fields per embryo, with few bacteria elsewhere, leading to an estimate of ∼79 bacteria per embryo. For the t = 24 wt embryos, the average maximal field had 21.7 ± 9.2 bacteria, but there was only one such field per embryo, typically with 3–4 other areas with 1–5 bacteria per field, resulting in an estimate of 33 bacteria per embryo. For the t = 24 <i>Jabba</i> mutant embryos, approximately 1/3 of the fields had the high bacterial count (∼180 ± 16.1 bacteria), and the rest typically had 10–30 bacteria per field, leading to an estimate of 840 bacteria per embryo. Finally, for the t = 48 hr wild-type, at most only one or two fields had any detectable bacteria (some embryos had none) so we estimate between 2–6 bacteria per embryo. In contrast, for the t = 48 <i>Jabba</i> embryo, every field was full of bacteria (200–250 bacteria per field), so assuming 10 such fields we estimate 2000–2500 bacteria per embryo.",

To make the bacterial suspension, a dilute overnight culture was grown to an absorbance of 0.5–0.6 at wavelength 595 nm. From this log-phase bacterial suspension, 5 ml was pelletted and the pellet washed with PBS. This bacterial pellet was then suspended in 200 μl of PBS and the metallic needle was dipped in for the bacterial infection assays. After the infection, the flies were maintained in 25°C fly incubator. Every 24 hr, the number of dead and live flies was counted.

All animals received human care in compliance with institutional guidelines regulated by the European Community. Food and water were available ad libitum. Male mice of approximately 8–12 weeks old were intraperitoneally injected with 20 ng LPS diluted in NaCl 0.9% or with an equivalent volume of NaCl and fasted for 16 hr. Hepatic LDs were isolated exactly as described in <a href=\"#bib36\">Turro et al., (2006)</a> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wan et al., 2007</a>). The protein fraction of LDs was separated by precipitation with 33% of cold TCA and the resulting pellets resuspended in 50 μl of 250 mM Tris, 2% SDS. The protein content was determined by the method of Lowry, and equal amount of protein of LDs was separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed as described previously. In some experiments, the LDs obtained from LPS-treated mice were diluted 1:3 in a 250-mM Tris buffer and incubated with 1 mg/ml of LPS or an equivalent volume of NaCl for 2 hr at 4°C. A soluble fraction of histones and other proteins was separated from the intact LDs by centrifugation at 16,000×<i>g</i> for 15 min in an Eppendorf microfuge. Finally, equal volumes of soluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and the presence of H1 determined by Western blotting. The primary antibodies used in immunoblot analysis of mouse samples were anti-histone H1, clone AE-4 from UPSTATE biotechnology (Millipore, MA, USA), Anti histone H1: sc-10806, anti histone H3 (FL-136): sc-10809 and anti histone H2B (FL-126): sc-10808 (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), anti histone H1.2, anti histone H2A and anti histone H2B (from Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

        "text": "This is a very nice description of a remarkable new finding – bacteria infected into <i>Drosophila</i> embryos are killed by the release of histones from lipid droplets. The finding that in Jabba mutants histones do not accumulate in lipid droplets allowed a direct test of the involvement of histones in the process. A large difference in bacterial growth was observed, and a four to five fold difference in embryo survival was observed upon injection with bacteria. While the results are outstanding, the manuscript preparation is a bit wanting. In particular, there should be more quantitative assessment of the effects observed.",

While such experiments are not absolutely required (<i>eLife</i> policy is to suggest just the absolutely essential experiments), the text must be modified to bring forth this important limitation; as of now the effect has been seen only in early embryos and not in adult flies.",

Given our new data on whole-fly data, and the expected large delay in being able to carry out the murine-droplet killing assays, we propose to leave establishing the efficacy of the murine droplets for future work. Accordingly, this section has been toned down as suggested by the reviewers, and in particular, we now include the sentence: “Determining whether the murine droplet-bound histones actively contribute to host defense remains for future studies.”",
